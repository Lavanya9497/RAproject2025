Machine learning in Medical applications project 
1. To describe the laboratory characteristics of patients with coronary calcification score using the regression approach
2. Compare the performance of classical machine learning techniques with foundation models for binary classification and multiclass classification
3. Evaluate the change in performance over different level of added missingness (5%,10%,15%) 
4. Evaluate real-world datasets(UCI Heart, Statlog, Framingham Heart Study) for the performance of foundation models.
